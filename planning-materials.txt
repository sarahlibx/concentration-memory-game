In plain language:
* Creating the Game Board:
    * Dynamically create HTML elements (e.g., div elements) for each card on the game board.
    * Assign a unique identifier or index to each card element.
    * Store the shuffled card value (from your array) in a way that's accessible to JavaScript, but hidden from the user (e.g., using data- attributes on the HTML elements).
* Handling Card Clicks:
    * Attach event listeners (e.g., click event) to each card element.
    * When a card is clicked:
        * "Flip" the card by changing its visual appearance (e.g., adding a CSS class that reveals the card's value).
        * Store the clicked card in a temporary array or variable (e.g., flippedCards).
        * If two cards are in flippedCards:
            * Compare the values: Access the hidden card values (e.g., from the data- attributes) of the two flipped cards.
            * If they match:
                * Keep the cards "flipped" (e.g., by adding a matched class and removing the ability to click them again).
                * Clear the flippedCards array.
            * If they don't match:
                * After a short delay (e.g., using setTimeout), "flip" the cards back over (e.g., by removing the "flipped" CSS class).
                * Clear the flippedCards array.
